# ImGui-SFML-Support
A SFML backend for Rust's ImGui port

## Code example
```rust
use imgui::Context;
use imgui_sfml_support::*;
use sfml::{graphics::{RenderWindow, RenderTarget, Color}, window::{Style, ContextSettings, Event}};

fn main() {
    let mut wnd = RenderWindow::new((800, 800), "Rust: SFML-ImGui", Style::CLOSE, &ContextSettings::default());

    let mut imgui = Context::create();
    let mut renderer = SFMLRenderer::init(&mut imgui);
    let mut platform = SFMLPlatform::init(&mut imgui, &wnd);


    while wnd.is_open() {
        while let Some(event) = wnd.poll_event() {
            platform.handle_event(&mut imgui, event);
            match event {
                Event::Closed => wnd.close(),
                _ => (),
            }


            platform.prepare_frame(&mut imgui);
            let ui = imgui.new_frame();
            // do your imgui work here
            ui.show_demo_window(&mut true);

            wnd.clear(Color::BLACK);
            wnd.reset_gl_states();

            renderer.render(&mut imgui, &mut wnd);

            wnd.display();
        }
    }
}

```

## Installation instructions
### IMPORTANT NOTE: This crate won't work out of the box!  
Due to how crates.io handles versioning, you should use the workaround specified below to get this working.  
To fix this, change in your `Cargo.toml` under `[dependencies]`:
```toml
# change this line
imgui-sfml-support = "0.1.1"
# to this line
imgui-sfml-support = { git = "https://github.com/truenotzero/imgui-sfml-support.git", branch="workaround" }
```
I have submitted a pull request in order to fix the issue, which has been accepted!  
However, due to how dependencies and versioning are handled by cargo, until `rust-sfml` doesn't update to `0.22.0`, the workaround is needed.  
This is because `rust-sfml` version `0.21.0` doesn't provide `sf::Context::getFunction()` which is required by the renderer used.
